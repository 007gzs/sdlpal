<p>SDLPAL is an SDL-based reimplementation of the classic Chinese-language RPG
"Xian Jian Qi Xia Zhuan" (also known as PAL or Legend of Sword and Fairy).</p>

<p>SDLPAL is distributed under the terms of GNU General Public License, version 3

gpl.txt for details.</p>

<p>Many of the ideas of this program are based on documents from PAL
Research Project (<a href="https://github.com/palxex/palresearch">https://github.com/palxex/palresearch</a>), and portions of the
code are based on the work done by Baldur and louyihua.</p>

<p>The getopt.c file is based on source code in OpenBSD.</p>

<p>The resampler code is based on the code in Kode54's foo_input_adplug project
(<a href="https://github.com/kode54/foo_input_adplug">https://github.com/kode54/foo_input_adplug</a>).</p>

<p>This program made extensive use of the following libraries:</p>

<p>SDL (<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>)
Adplug (<a href="http://adplug.sourceforge.net/">http://adplug.sourceforge.net/</a>)
SDL_mixer (<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/</a>)

libogg &amp; libvorbis (<a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">http://www.vorbis.com/</a>)</p>

<p>And some of the OPL simulation cores this program used are from the DOSBOX
project (<a href="http://www.dosbox.com">http://www.dosbox.com</a>).</p>

<p>Please see authors.txt for additional authors.</p>

<p>This program does NOT include any code or data files of the original game,
which is proprietary and copyrighted by SoftStar Inc.</p>

<h1>
<a id="compile-under-windows" class="anchor" href="#compile-under-windows" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COMPILE UNDER WINDOWS</h1>

<p>The following compilers/IDEs are supported under Windows:</p>

<p>1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher (official)
2) Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2 (unofficial)
3) Open Watcom 1.7 (unofficial)</p>

<p>To compile, open the respective project file (sdlpal.sln, sdlpal.dev, or
sdlpal.wpj). You need to have SDL 2.0 development files installed.</p>

<h1>
<a id="compile-under-gnulinux" class="anchor" href="#compile-under-gnulinux" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COMPILE UNDER GNU/LINUX</h1>

<p>To compile, type:</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>You need to have SDL 2.0 development files installed. The compiled executable
should be generated with the filename 'sdlpal' at the top directory of source
files.</p>

<p>SDLPAL should also be able to compile and run under other UNIX-like systems, 
however it's not tested.</p>

<h1>
<a id="compile-under-mac-os-x" class="anchor" href="#compile-under-mac-os-x" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COMPILE UNDER MAC OS X</h1>

<p>To compile, open the project Pal.xcodeproj with Xcode, and click Build. You
need to have SDL framework installed at /Library/Frameworks.</p>

<p>The compiled bundle should work as a "universal" binary which works on both
Intel and PowerPC.</p>

<h1>
<a id="classic-build" class="anchor" href="#classic-build" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CLASSIC BUILD</h1>

<p>By default, SDLPAL uses a revised battle system which is more exciting yet
somewhat harder than the original game. If you prefer the traditional
turn-based battle system, uncomment the following line:</p>

<p>//#define PAL_CLASSIC           1</p>

<p>in the file common.h and recompile. This will build a "classic" build which is
100% the same as the original game.</p>

<h1>
<a id="running-the-game" class="anchor" href="#running-the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RUNNING THE GAME</h1>

<p>The data files required for running the game are not included with the source
package due to copyright issues. You must obtain them from the original CD.</p>

<p>To run the game, copy all the files on the original CD to a directory, then
copy the SDLPAL executable to the same directory, and run the executable.</p>

<p>Note that the filenames of data files should be in lower-case under GNU/Linux
(or other UNIX-like operating systems).</p>

<h1>
<a id="configure-the-game" class="anchor" href="#configure-the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CONFIGURE THE GAME</h1>

<p>PAL has several variants using different and incompatible resource files. Now
SDLPAL supports several configuration options for supporting such variants.</p>

<p>To set these configuration options, create a file named as 'sdlpal.cfg' (make
sure to use lower-case file name in UNIX-like operating systems) in the game
directory created by the above step. If no configuration file exists, SDLPAL
uses default values that supports the original resources of DOS version.</p>

<p>Please refer to the 'sdlpal.cfg.example' for configuration file format.</p>
