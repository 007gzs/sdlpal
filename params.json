See\r\ngpl.txt for details.\r\n\r\nMany of the ideas of this program are based on documents from PAL\r\nResearch Project (https://github.com/palxex/palresearch), and portions of the\r\ncode are based on the work done by Baldur and louyihua.\r\n\r\nThe getopt.c file is based on source code in OpenBSD.\r\n\r\nThe resampler code is based on the code in Kode54's foo_input_adplug project\r\n(https://github.com/kode54/foo_input_adplug).\r\n\r\nThis program made extensive use of the following libraries:\r\n\r\nSDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)\r\nAdplug (http://adplug.sourceforge.net/)\r\nSDL_mixer (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)\r\nlibmad (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/)\r\nlibogg & libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com/)\r\n\r\nAnd some of the OPL simulation cores this program used are from the DOSBOX\r\nproject (http://www.dosbox.com).\r\n\r\nPlease see authors.txt for additional authors.\r\n\r\nThis program does NOT include any code or data files of the original game,\r\nwhich is proprietary and copyrighted by SoftStar Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILE UNDER WINDOWS\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe following compilers/IDEs are supported under Windows:\r\n\r\n1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher (official)\r\n2) Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2 (unofficial)\r\n3) Open Watcom 1.7 (unofficial)\r\n\r\nTo compile, open the respective project file (sdlpal.sln, sdlpal.dev, or\r\nsdlpal.wpj). You need to have SDL 2.0 development files installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILE UNDER GNU/LINUX\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nTo compile, type:\r\n\r\nmake\r\n\r\nYou need to have SDL 2.0 development files installed. The compiled executable\r\nshould be generated with the filename 'sdlpal' at the top directory of source\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nSDLPAL should also be able to compile and run under other UNIX-like systems, \r\nhowever it's not tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILE UNDER MAC OS X\r\n======================\r\n\r\nTo compile, open the project Pal.xcodeproj with Xcode, and click Build. You\r\nneed to have SDL framework installed at /Library/Frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe compiled bundle should work as a \"universal\" binary which works on both\r\nIntel and PowerPC.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIC BUILD\r\n=============\r\n\r\nBy default, SDLPAL uses a revised battle system which is more exciting yet\r\nsomewhat harder than the original game. If you prefer the traditional\r\nturn-based battle system, uncomment the following line:\r\n\r\n//#define PAL_CLASSIC           1\r\n\r\nin the file common.h and recompile. This will build a \"classic\" build which is\r\n100% the same as the original game.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNING THE GAME\r\n================\r\n\r\nThe data files required for running the game are not included with the source\r\npackage due to copyright issues. You must obtain them from the original CD.\r\n\r\nTo run the game, copy all the files on the original CD to a directory, then\r\ncopy the SDLPAL executable to the same directory, and run the executable.\r\n\r\nNote that the filenames of data files should be in lower-case under GNU/Linux\r\n(or other UNIX-like operating systems).\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIGURE THE GAME\r\n==================\r\n\r\nPAL has several variants using different and incompatible resource files. Now\r\nSDLPAL supports several configuration options for supporting such variants.\r\n\r\nTo set these configuration options, create a file named as 'sdlpal.cfg' (make\r\nsure to use lower-case file name in UNIX-like operating systems) in the game\r\ndirectory created by the above step. If no configuration file exists, SDLPAL\r\nuses default values that supports the original resources of DOS version.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the 'sdlpal.cfg.example' for configuration file format.\r\n\r\n\r\n-END OF FILE-\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
