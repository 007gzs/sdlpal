#FullScreen=0

# KeepAspectRatio: Indicates whether the content in game window should keep its original

# MessageFileName: Indicates whether to use external message & word files. Only need to specify

#                  '.wrd' file is the word file. All files have the format '<idx>=<content>',
#                  where the start value of <idx> are 0 for the index file and 1 for the other
#                  two files. Note that, the <content> of the index file is a series of numbers
#                  spearated by commas, and each number is one of the <idx>s in the message
#                  file, while value '0' means wait for key and value '-1' means end. And the
#                  <idx> of the index file is the value of the first 0xFFFF instruction of one
#                  dialog in SSS.MKF. By default, this option is disabled. All such files should
#                  be UTF-8 encoded, without leading BOM bytes.
